## Please note that I have made changes that invalidate the information in the readme. To run create the saved_articles directory, if it isn't pulled from the repo, then use Python 3.6+ and run `python3 news.py`. I'll fix the readme soon, and provide a better way to install and run. Thanks. - Tom

# News at the Command line
### Want to be kept updated without visiting the news portals every now and then

 Now you don't need to visit each news portal website separately to read their articles. Just use the tool and read the articles without even clicking a single mouse button.


# Modules Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Requests** 
- **Beautiful Soup** 
- **PyYAML**

To install the module dependencies before running the application, simply navigate into the project folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Working
- All sample input images are placed under the **Images** folder.
- You can change the maximum number of posts in **config.yml**. Look for **Limit** attribute.

# How To Use
 Make sure you have installed required libraries, instructions above.
 Just run the main.py, do this by typing `py main.py`. 
 The rest is quite straight forward.
